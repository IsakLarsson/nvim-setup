# I use Neovim (btw)

I no longer use this, I've since switched to NvChad as my base setup. See [my custom repo](https://github.com/IsakLarsson/nvchad-custom) for my custom setup

My personal Neovim config, a work in progress, always changing and evolving.

I am currently trying out a different config that is based on NvChad, find my custom files [here](https://github.com/IsakLarsson/nvchad-custom)
